# DWM
Best wm with my own custom color scheme and patches.

# Compositor
I use a fork of [compton](https://github.com/tryone144/compton) with blur and stuff.

# Browser
I use librewolf with [this](https://github.com/mut-ex/minimal-functional-fox) modification; and my own color scheme.

# Install
The install script just copies picom.conf to /etc/xdg, then unzips DWM and make installs it.
